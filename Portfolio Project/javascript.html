            <p class="p-JS">This was my first JavaScript project and I enjoyed working on it a lot, It intoduced me to somewhat more advanced math with code and how these simple games make their mechanics.</p>

            <p>How the game works</p>
            <p class="p-JS">when you first enter you will see this picture:</p>
            <br>
            <img src="pictures/Screenshot_10.png" class="image-JS">
            <p class="p-JS">pressing on the cube will start off 2 things; 1. a timer and 2 a sequence of cubes, everytime you press on a cube, a new one will spawn on the canvas at a random location, this will repeat till the timer reaches 10seconds. once it reached its time the game round is over, and a count of the amount of cubes you've hit in that time frame will show</p>
